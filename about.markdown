Hi there! My name is Andrew, and I am an up and coming software engineer based in Vancouver, BC. I'm passionate about building innovative solutions that solve complex problems.


I am currently a student, but I enjoy making video games in C++, exercising at the local gym and overall learning new things about different programming languages, algorithms and techniques. I believe that a healthy work-life balance is important for overall well-being, and I try to maintain that balance by dedicating time to things that bring me overall happiness and joy.

Thank you for taking the time to read my about page. If you'd like to connect, please feel free to reach out via email at andrew1668@live.ca
